SelfMonitor External Anti-Cloning and Copyright Protection Playbook (2026 Q1)

Document owner: Security + Legal
Status: Active baseline
Applies to: Web, Mobile, API, Brand, Commercial materials

1) Objective
This playbook defines external protection controls against:
- full product cloning;
- unauthorized source reuse;
- brand impersonation;
- unlawful redistribution of exported artifacts and templates.

2) Threat model (external)
Primary external risks:
- look-alike apps in app stores;
- typo-squatted domains and phishing mirrors;
- copied UI/content/marketing pages;
- API scraping and automated data harvesting;
- leaked source snapshots used to launch clone services;
- unauthorized resale of templates, exports, and branded assets.

3) Legal perimeter (mandatory)
3.1 Copyright and ownership hygiene
- Ensure all code/assets/docs contain ownership notices where required.
- Keep authorship and commit history intact for evidence.
- Keep the proprietary repository LICENSE current.

3.2 Contractual perimeter
- Terms of Service and EULA must explicitly prohibit reverse engineering, mirroring, scraping, and derivative competing products.
- Partner/vendor contracts must include IP assignment, confidentiality, and non-compete language for deliverables.

3.3 Trademark perimeter
- Register and maintain key word marks/logo marks for priority geographies.
- Reserve close variants for brand names in app stores and social platforms.
- Maintain a trademark watch list and monthly conflict review.

4) External monitoring and detection
4.1 App and web impersonation watch
- Weekly checks in Apple App Store / Google Play for look-alike names and icons.
- Weekly scan for typo domains and TLS cert issuance for suspicious domains.
- Weekly search for copied landing pages and docs.

4.2 Code and asset leak watch
- Weekly search for public repositories containing unique product strings.
- Track known signatures (UI text fragments, endpoint naming patterns, watermark labels).
- Use takedown automation queue for verified leaks.

4.3 Marketplace and social watch
- Weekly checks on freelancer marketplaces and social channels for unauthorized "resale clone" offers.
- Archive evidence with URL, timestamp, screenshot, and hash.

5) Technical external controls (already part of baseline)
5.1 API gateway anti-automation
- Global rate-limits and auth endpoint burst controls.
- Signature-based blocking for known scanner traffic and suspicious URI patterns.
- Enforced request method policy and security headers.

5.2 Export fingerprinting
- Attach per-download watermark identifiers to CSV/PDF exports.
- Include user fingerprint + timestamped watermark metadata for attribution evidence.
- Store enough context to support legal chain-of-custody.

5.3 Mobile attestation for sensitive actions
- Sensitive mobile security endpoints require mobile attestation session tokens.
- Validate attestation subject and installation identifier binding.
- Reject requests with missing/mismatched attestation headers.

6) Evidence and chain-of-custody
For each incident, collect:
- screenshot/video capture;
- offending URL/app listing/repository reference;
- timestamp in UTC;
- SHA256 hash of collected evidence;
- related watermark IDs (if export leakage is involved);
- relevant API/security logs (non-PII where possible).

Retention:
- keep full evidence for at least 24 months or per legal requirements.

7) Enforcement workflow (SLA)
T+0 to T+4h:
- classify incident severity (critical/high/medium/low);
- freeze and preserve evidence;
- assign legal and security owners.

T+4h to T+24h:
- submit platform takedown notices (app store, host, registrar, social);
- issue cease-and-desist for clear infringement;
- rotate exposed secrets/tokens if leakage is suspected.

T+24h to T+72h:
- escalate repeat offenders via counsel;
- notify affected partners if contractual/IP impact exists;
- publish internal post-incident report with corrective actions.

8) Incident severity matrix
Critical:
- active phishing clone collecting credentials;
- clone with unauthorized access to production APIs;
- leaked proprietary source with live secret exposure.

High:
- public clone app/site with copied brand and user confusion risk;
- repeated automated scraping bypass attempts.

Medium:
- copied non-sensitive content without active abuse.

Low:
- isolated brand misuse with low confusion impact.

9) Governance and KPIs
Monthly review metrics:
- time-to-detect impersonation incidents;
- time-to-takedown by platform;
- number of repeat offenders;
- percentage of leaked exports with attributable watermark match;
- rate-limit/WAF block trend for scraping signatures.

Quarterly gates:
- legal text review (Terms/EULA/LICENSE);
- anti-automation policy tuning;
- anti-cloning tabletop exercise.

10) 30/60/90 day execution plan
0-30 days:
- finalize watchlists (stores/domains/repos/marketplaces);
- define evidence templates and legal notice templates;
- train on-call responders.

31-60 days:
- automate detection feeds and alerting for impersonation signals;
- integrate takedown ticketing workflow with SLA tracking.

61-90 days:
- run red-team style cloning simulation;
- close policy gaps and publish revised playbook.

11) Minimum ownership model
- Security owner: technical detection and abuse response.
- Legal owner: notice drafting, takedown, escalation.
- Product owner: user communication and trust messaging.
- Engineering owner: hardening actions and release gates.
