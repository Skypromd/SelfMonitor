# External Pentest Playbook (2026 Q1)

Date: 2026-02-17
Owner: Security Engineering
Target window: Before production scale-up / after every major auth release

## 1. Engagement goals

- Validate resilience of auth and session controls against real attacker techniques
- Validate web/mobile security posture for account takeover and privilege escalation
- Produce independently verified findings with reproducible evidence

## 2. Targets

Primary targets:
- Auth API (`/register`, `/token`, `/token/refresh`, `/security/*`, `/2fa/*`)
- Web Security Center (`/security`)
- Mobile shell auth bridge and secure session handling

Secondary targets:
- Partner-registry reminder and webhook integrations
- Edge/API routing and exposed service headers

## 3. Rules of engagement

- Test only approved staging environment unless explicitly approved for production
- No destructive data loss tests in shared environments
- No social engineering without separate written authorization
- Use dedicated test accounts and seeded data set

## 4. Required test suites

1. Authentication and session management
   - credential stuffing and password spraying resistance
   - refresh token replay and session fixation attempts
   - token invalidation after password change / lockdown
2. Authorization and privilege boundaries
   - horizontal and vertical privilege escalation
   - stale token and step-up bypass attempts
3. MFA and account recovery
   - MFA enrollment/disable abuse paths
   - email verification challenge brute force and replay
4. API and web app security
   - OWASP API Top 10 checks
   - OWASP ASVS L2 relevant controls
   - input handling, rate limits, and error disclosure
5. Mobile shell controls
   - secure storage bypass attempts
   - WebView bridge injection and message spoofing
   - deep-link abuse and unauthorized route transitions

## 5. Deliverables required from pentest vendor

- Executive summary with risk rating
- Full technical report with exploit paths and proof-of-concept
- CVSS scoring per finding
- Retest report for remediated findings
- Raw evidence package (requests, traces, screenshots)

## 6. Severity policy and remediation SLA

- Critical: fix or compensating control before release
- High: remediate within 7 calendar days
- Medium: remediate within 30 calendar days
- Low: planned hardening backlog

## 7. Internal acceptance checklist

- [ ] Scope signed by engineering + product + security
- [ ] Test accounts and data prepared
- [ ] Findings triaged and owners assigned
- [ ] All Critical/High issues resolved or formally risk-accepted
- [ ] Retest completed and attached to release packet
