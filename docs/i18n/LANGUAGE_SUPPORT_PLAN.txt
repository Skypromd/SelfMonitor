Language Support Plan (Future-proof i18n)
Last updated: 2026-02-12

Required product languages
- English (UK): en-GB
- Russian: ru-RU
- Ukrainian: uk-UA
- Polish: pl-PL
- Moldovan (Romanian Moldova): ro-MD
- Turkish: tr-TR
- Hungarian: hu-HU

Scalability requirements
1) Locale registry
   - Keep centralized locale list in localization-service and web config.
   - Expose /translations/locales to drive UI selectors dynamically.

2) Fallback strategy
   - Default fallback: en-GB.
   - Locale can launch in fallback mode and get translated incrementally.
   - Never break UI when locale has partial coverage.

3) Namespace-based translation loading
   - Keep namespaces (common, nav, reports, documents, etc.).
   - Support partial namespace overrides per locale.

4) Operational visibility
   - Track missing keys, fallback-hit rate, and untranslated namespace counts.
   - Add telemetry dashboard for translation health per locale.

5) Content workflow
   - Move from in-code dictionaries to external translation source (TMS/JSON catalogs).
   - Add translation versioning and deployment-safe cache invalidation.

6) UX and formatting
   - Add locale-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and currency.
   - Add pluralization/message format support (ICU-style).

Current implementation status
- Locale registry implemented in localization-service.
- Fallback-by-default implemented for non-translated locales.
- Web locale config includes required language list.
- Translation health telemetry endpoint implemented: `GET /translations/health`
  with per-locale missing keys, estimated fallback hit-rate, and untranslated namespace metrics.
- Translation catalogs externalized to JSON files (`services/localization-service/catalogs/*`)
  and loaded at runtime via `LOCALIZATION_CATALOG_DIR` (with safe in-code fallback).
- ICU/pluralization enabled in web i18n hook via `intl-messageformat`, with locale-aware
  formatting helpers for date/time/number/currency sourced from
  `GET /translations/{locale}/format-standards`.
