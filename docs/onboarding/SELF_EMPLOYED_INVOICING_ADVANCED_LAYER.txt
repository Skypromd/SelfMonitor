Self-Employed Invoicing Advanced Layer (Implemented)
Date: 2026-02-12

Goal
- Complete the advanced invoicing layer for UK self-employed users:
  1) recurring invoices
  2) payment links
  3) auto-overdue by due date
  4) reminder notifications
  5) branded templates

What is implemented

1. Recurring invoices
- New recurring plan model and API for schedule-based invoice generation.
- Supported cadences: weekly, monthly, quarterly.
- One-shot run endpoint (manual trigger).
- Batch run endpoint for all due plans.
- Generated invoices are linked to the originating recurring plan.

2. Payment links
- Every created self-employed invoice gets a payment link URL.
- Link base URL and provider are configurable via env vars:
  - SELF_EMPLOYED_PAYMENT_LINK_BASE_URL
  - SELF_EMPLOYED_PAYMENT_LINK_PROVIDER
- Payment link is exposed in API responses and visible in dashboard table.

3. Auto-overdue
- Issued invoices with due_date in the past are auto-transitioned to overdue.
- Auto-overdue is executed on key read paths (list/detail/status flow), so status is kept fresh.

4. Reminder notifications
- Reminder events are persisted (type, channel, status, message, sent_at).
- Reminder run endpoint processes:
  - due_soon invoices (within configurable window)
  - overdue invoices
- Reminder cooldown guard prevents noisy repeats (24h window per invoice using reminder_last_sent_at).
- Reminder history list endpoint added.
- Real dispatch channels supported:
  - in_app (always)
  - email (if enabled + customer_email present)
  - sms (if enabled + customer_phone present)
- Provider adapters:
  - Email: webhook or SendGrid
  - SMS: webhook or Twilio
- Delivery retry policy:
  - Exponential backoff retries for transient codes (408/409/425/429/5xx)
  - Retry count and base delay configurable via env

5. Branded templates
- User-level invoice brand profile:
  - business_name
  - logo_url
  - accent_color
  - payment_terms_note
- Brand profile can be saved and reused on new invoices.
- Invoice PDF/CSV export now includes branding and payment link fields.

  - brand_accent_color
  - reminder_last_sent_at

Operational note
- External dispatch failures are persisted as failed reminder events (per channel) and do not break reminder run execution.
- Readiness endpoint gives channel/provider config health without sending messages.
- Smoke-check endpoint validates configuration and can optionally perform real sandbox delivery checks.
