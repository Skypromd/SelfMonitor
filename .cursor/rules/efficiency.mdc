# Agent Efficiency Rules

## File Creation Policy
- NEVER create summary files, changelogs, or documentation files unless explicitly requested.
- NEVER create TODO.md, CHANGES.md, SUMMARY.md, NOTES.md, or similar meta-files.
- Only create files that are part of the actual deliverable: source code, tests, configs.
- Each unnecessary file = full context re-read = wasted tokens.

## Code Change Policy
- Make minimal, focused changes. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not add comments that narrate what the code does ("// get the user", "// return result").
- Do not add empty lines or formatting changes to files you didn't functionally modify.
- When fixing a bug, change only what's needed to fix it — not the whole file.

## Communication Policy
- Be concise. No filler phrases ("Let me think about this", "Great question!", "Sure, I'd be happy to").
- Answer first, explain after — if explanation is needed at all.
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs, for lists of changes.
- Never repeat the user's question back to them.

## Testing Policy
- Run existing tests after changes, don't write new tests unless asked.
- If tests are needed, put them in the project's existing test structure.
- Don't create test infrastructure (mock servers, test databases) unless the project already has it.

## Context Efficiency
- When given a specific file via @, work only with that file — don't scan the whole project.
- Prefer targeted reads (specific file + line range) over broad searches.
- Don't re-read files you've already read in this session unless they've changed.
- Batch related changes into one edit when possible — each edit re-reads context.
