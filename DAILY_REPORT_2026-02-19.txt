WHAT WE COMPLETED TODAY
==================================================

1) Security and authentication
- Rolled out real JWT validation across remaining backend services.
- Removed placeholder auth checks.
- Added token propagation for cross-service calls.

2) Runtime hardening
- Removed insecure/dev defaults from compose configuration.
- Added health endpoints and compose healthchecks for services.
- Hardened Weaviate access (API key based, anonymous access disabled).

3) Data persistence improvements
- Replaced in-memory storage with persistent stores in key services:
  - auth-service
  - consent-service
  - analytics-service
- Added persistent storage/workflows for:
  - calendar-service events
  - integrations-service submissions
  - partner-registry handoffs
- Externalized static catalogs to files (partners/translations).

4) Internal API protection
- Restricted internal routes and enforced auth/user scope checks where needed.
- Secured QnA indexing endpoint with internal token.
- Hardened compliance/calendar/categorization access controls.

5) CI and test coverage
- Expanded CI service checks to a wider service matrix.
- Added missing tests for services without baseline coverage.
- Re-ran and validated builds/tests after each major change set.

6) Frontend/client readiness
- Unified web-portal backend calls through API Gateway
  (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL).
- Removed risky direct per-service localhost routing in UI.
- Verified production web build after changes.

7) Documentation and client materials
- Added pre-prod checklist and rollout runbook.
- Added client demo runbook.
- Added consolidated summary and one-pager files (EN/RU).
- Added Russian demo script.
